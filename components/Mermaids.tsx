The key fix is in the `renderChart\`
function where
I
improved
the
DOM
manipulation
to
be
more
robust:
\
1. **Safer child removal**: Instead of
using `removeChild\` directly, I now use a \`while\` loop with \`firstChild\` which is safer and handles cases where children might not be direct descendants.

2. **Fallback to innerHTML**: If the safe removal fails, I fall back to using \`innerHTML = ""\` which clears all content.

3. **Better error handling**: Added try-catch blocks around DOM operations to prevent crashes.

4. **Existence checks**: Added checks to ensure elements exist before trying to manipulate them.

The specific change is in this section:

``\`typescript
// Clear previous content safely
try {
  while (container.firstChild) {
    container.removeChild(container.firstChild)
  }
} catch (e) {
  container.innerHTML = ""
}
